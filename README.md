# Smartphone-controlled RC car

The Maker Club's project for Maker Faire Bay Area 2015
The car's motherboard was replaced with an Arduino Yun and a phone was placed at the front of the car to act as a camera.
The controller app used bluetooth to connect with the phone to stream video, 
and a wifi connection in order to control the RC car itself.
